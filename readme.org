* Dream Stack
This is the API kitchen sink. Incorporating everything I know to be cool and useful in some way, possibly not all together.

- Its event-sourced based
- Uses Kafka
- Microservices, all scalable
- gRPC as the atoms of the system, little lambdas
- Messages trigger lambdas
- GraphQL as the scheduler of those atoms
- REST as an interface, through a dynamic ( ie: you can configure it via the API ) gateway
- Map REST shapes to GraphQL queries
- Postgres as an index
- Domain logic handled by pure functions, including RBAC
